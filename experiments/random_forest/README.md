# Random Forest Experiments

This directory contains the Random Forest machine learning models for predicting Pyracantha angustifolia invasion risk with seasonal awareness.

## Files Overview

### Core Model Files
- **`seasonal_predictor.py`** - Enhanced Random Forest model with seasonal pattern recognition
- **`pyracantha_predictor.py`** - Original baseline Random Forest model (for comparison)

### Visualization & Analysis
- **`seasonal_heatmap_generator.py`** - Generates seasonal-aware invasion risk heatmaps
- **`seasonal_comparison.py`** - Creates comparative visualizations (peak vs off-season)

### Output Files (`outputs/`)
- **`seasonal_pyracantha_model.pkl`** - Trained seasonal Random Forest model
- **`seasonal_model_summary.json`** - Model performance metrics and seasonal patterns
- **`peak_season_invasion_map.html`** - Peak season (April) invasion risk heatmap
- **`off_season_invasion_map.html`** - Off-season (July) invasion risk heatmap
- **`evaluation_report.json`** - Model evaluation metrics
- **`feature_importance.png`** - Feature importance visualization
- **`model_performance.png`** - Model performance plots

## Key Features

### Seasonal Intelligence
The enhanced model captures:
- **Peak Season**: Autumn (March-May) - 66% of observations
- **Peak Month**: April - 40% of all sightings
- **Flowering Patterns**: Seasonal intensity mapping
- **Temporal Dynamics**: Recent observations weighted more heavily

### Model Performance
- **Accuracy**: ~50% (seasonal patterns learned)
- **Seasonal Enhancement**: +52.9% risk during peak flowering
- **Features**: 71 weather and temporal variables
- **API Integration**: Real-time weather data from NASA POWER

## Usage

### Generate Seasonal Model
```bash
python seasonal_predictor.py
```

### Create Risk Heatmaps
```bash
# Single peak season map
python seasonal_heatmap_generator.py

# Peak vs off-season comparison
python seasonal_comparison.py
```

## Results Summary

The seasonal model successfully learned that:
- Pyracantha invasion risk is **1.53x higher** during flowering season
- April shows the highest invasion potential (peak flowering)
- Winter months (July) have significantly lower risk
- Real weather patterns influence invasion success rates

## Dependencies
- scikit-learn
- pandas, numpy
- folium (mapping)
- aiohttp (async API calls)
- matplotlib, seaborn (visualization)
